I earned my Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from CMU and my Bachelor’s degree from the University of Edinburgh, where I had the privilege of being supervised by Prof. <a href="https://vios.science/team/tsaftaris" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Sotirios Tsaftaris</a> and Tianjin University. During my PhD, I’ve also had the opportunity to collaborate with Prof. <a href="https://jd92.wang/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jindong Wang</a> and Prof. <a href="https://huguosheng.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Guosheng Hu</a>.</p> <p><strong>Research Interests</strong></p> <p>My research focuses on enhancing generative AI through data-centric machine learning:</p> <ul> <li>Exploring the relationship between pre-training data (e.g., corruption, bias, diversity) and the behaviors/physics of foundation models.</li> <li>Developing fine-tuning strategies to address catastrophic inheritance from pre-training, ensuring more reliable foundation models for downstream applications.</li> <li>Investigating learning methods that handle various types of imperfect data and labels within the context of foundation models.</li> <li>Advancing multi-modality foundation models by understanding their individual components from a data-centric perspective.</li> </ul> <p>I’m open to collaboration on relevant topics. I’m happy to mentor students in research and particularly encourage those from underrepresented groups to reach out.</p> </body></html>

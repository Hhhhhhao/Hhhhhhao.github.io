**About Me**

I’m a 4th-year PhD candidate at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where I am advised by Prof. [Bhiksha Raj](https://cmu-mlsp.github.io/team/bhiksha_raj). I earned my Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from CMU and my Bachelor’s degree from the University of Edinburgh, where I had the privilege of being supervised by Prof. [Sotirios Tsaftaris](https://vios.science/team/tsaftaris) and Tianjin University. I’ve also been fortunate to have the opportunity to collaborate with Prof. [Jindong Wang](https://jd92.wang/) along the way.

**Research Interests**

My research focuses on enhancing generative AI through data-centric machine learning:

* Exploring the relationship between pre-training data (e.g., corruption, bias, diversity) and the behaviors/physics of foundation models.
* Developing fine-tuning strategies to address catastrophic inheritance from pre-training, ensuring more reliable foundation models for downstream applications.
* Investigating learning methods that handle various types of imperfect data and labels within the context of foundation models.
* Advancing multi-modality foundation models by understanding their individual components from a data-centric perspective.

I'm open to collaboration on relevant topics. I’m happy to mentor students in research and particularly encourage those from underrepresented groups to reach out.
